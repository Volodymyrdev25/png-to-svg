# png2svg

Small utility for converting PNG files to SVG Tiny 1.2

## Features and limitations

* Draws rectangles for each region in the PNG image that can be covered by a rectangle.
* The remaining pixels are drawn with a rectangle for each pixel.
* This is not an efficient representation of PNG images.
* The conversion may be useful if you have a small PNG image or icons at sizes around 16x16, and wish to scale it up and print it out without artifacts.
* The utility is fast for small images, but larger images will take an unreasonable amount of time to convert, creating SVG files many megabytes in size.
* The resulting SVG images can be opened directly in a browser like Chromium.
* Written in pure Go, with no runtime dependencies on any external library or utility.
* For creating SVG images that draws a rectangle for each and every pixel, use the `-p` flag.
