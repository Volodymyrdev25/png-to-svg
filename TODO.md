Try this:

1. Select a random location.
2. Place a square.
3. Expand the square in all directions as long as the colors are the same (or within a given threshold).
4. Continue until a given numbers of rectangles have been placed, or a given coverage have been achieved.
5. Use pixel-rectangles for the rest of the pixels.

Then try the same method, but also include small polygons and circles?
