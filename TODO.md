# TODO

- [ ] Check if grouping by width gives better results than grouping by color.
- [ ] Try grouping first by color, then by width and then by height.
- [ ] See if randomly placed expanding rectangles gives better results.
- [ ] See if bringing expanding circles into the mix gives better results (with a separate cover bool for circles?).
- [ ] See if bringing expanding polygons into the mix gives better results (with a separate cover bool for polygons?).
- [ ] Don't check `r`, `g` and `b`. Use a single value for checking if the color matches.
- [ ] Remove panics that were used during debugging, but are not needed anymore.
- [ ] Test with partially transparent PNG images.
